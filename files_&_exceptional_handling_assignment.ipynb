        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages  \n",
        "Answer: Compiled languages (like C++) are translated into machine code before execution, making them faster. Interpreted languages (like Python) are executed line-by-line, offering easier debugging and platform independence.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python  \n",
        "Answer: Exception handling manages runtime errors using constructs like try, except, else, and finally, enabling graceful error handling without crashing the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling  \n",
        "Answer: The finally block is always executed after try/except, used for cleanup operations like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python  \n",
        "Answer: Logging records events during code execution. It helps debug, audit, and monitor programs using the logging module.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python  \n",
        "Answer: __del__ is a destructor called when an object is deleted. It's used to release resources or perform cleanup before object destruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python  \n",
        "Answer: import module imports the whole module. from module import name imports specific objects, functions, or classes directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python  \n",
        "Answer: Use multiple except blocks or a tuple in a single except to handle different exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python  \n",
        "Answer: It automatically manages resources, ensuring files are closed properly even if exceptions occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing  \n",
        "Answer: Multithreading runs threads in one process (shared memory). Multiprocessing runs separate processes (independent memory), avoiding GIL in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program  \n",
        "Answer: Debugging, error tracking, monitoring, and maintaining execution history.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python  \n",
        "Answer: It involves allocation, usage, and release of memory using reference counting and garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python  \n",
        "Answer: Use try for risky code, except to handle exceptions, else to run if no error, and finally for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python  \n",
        "Answer: It prevents memory leaks, ensures efficiency, and avoids crashes due to resource overuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling  \n",
        "Answer: try contains risky code, except catches and handles errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work  \n",
        "Answer: It uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to reclaim unused memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling  \n",
        "Answer: Executes if no exception occurs in try, keeping logic clean and separated.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python  \n",
        "Answer: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python  \n",
        "Answer: os.fork() is low-level and Unix-only. multiprocessing is high-level, cross-platform, and manages separate memory/processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python  \n",
        "Answer: To release resources, flush buffers, and avoid file corruption or locks.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python  \n",
        "Answer: file.read() reads the entire content. file.readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for  \n",
        "Answer: To track events, errors, or messages with various severity levels during program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling  \n",
        "Answer: It helps interact with the file system: checking paths, managing files/directories, and environment variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python  \n",
        "Answer: Circular references, memory leaks, late garbage collection, and high memory consumption in large data.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python  \n",
        "Answer: Use raise statement, e.g., raise ValueError(\"message\")\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?  \n",
        "Answer: Multithreading improves efficiency in I/O-bound tasks like file handling or networking by running multiple operations concurrently.\n"
