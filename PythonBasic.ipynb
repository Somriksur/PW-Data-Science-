        "\n",
        "--An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of converting the entire code into machine language at once (like a compiler), the Python interpreter processes each line one at a time, which makes it easier to:\n",

        "\n",
        "-- What Are Pre-defined Keywords in Python?\n",
        "Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning in the language. You cannot use them as variable names, function names, or identifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are part of Python’s syntax and structure and are recognized by the interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        " Examples of Python Keywords:\n",
        "if, else, elif – for conditional statements\n",
        "\n",
        "for, while – for loops\n",

        "--  No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "Keywords are reserved by Python because they have special meanings and are part of the language’s syntax. Using them as variable names will result in a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) What is mutability in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "-- What Is Mutability in Python?\n",
        "Mutability refers to whether an object in Python can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "If an object can be changed, it is called mutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "If it cannot be changed, it is called immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        " Examples of Mutable Objects:\n",
        "These objects can be modified in place.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "\n",
        "--In Python, lists are mutable because they are designed for storing collections of data that can change — you can add, remove, or modify elements. Tuples are immutable because they are intended for fixed data that should not change after creation, which improves performance, memory efficiency, and ensures data integrity. This immutability also allows tuples (if they contain only immutable items) to be used as dictionary keys, unlike lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "--In Python, the == operator checks whether two variables have the same value, while the is operator checks whether two variables refer to the exact same object in memory. For example, a == b is True if a and b contain equal data, but a is b is True only if they point to the same memory location. This means == compares contents, and is compares identity.\n",
        "\n",
        "8)  What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "--Logical Operators in Python\n",
        "Logical operators in Python are used to combine multiple conditions and return a Boolean value (True or False).\n",
        "The logical operators in Python are:\n",

        "\n",
        "9) What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "--Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type into another, such as converting a string to an integer, or a float to a string. This is done using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "10) What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "\n",
        "--Implicit type casting is automatically done by Python when it converts one data type to another during an operation (e.g., int to float).\n",
        "Explicit type casting is when the programmer manually converts a data type using functions like int(), float(), or str().\n",
        "\n",
        "11) What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "--The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of a program by executing certain blocks of code only when specific conditions are met. They help make decisions using statements like if, elif, and else.\n",
        "\n",
        "12) How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "\n",
        "--The elif (short for \"else if\") statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions after an initial if condition. If the if condition is False, Python checks each elif condition in order. The first elif that is True gets executed, and the rest are skipped. If none are True, the else block (if present) runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13) What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
        "\n",
        "--The for loop in Python is used when you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, or range) a specific number of times, while the while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true, without necessarily knowing how many times it will run.\n",
        "\n",
        "14) Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n",
        "\n",
        "--A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when you don’t know in advance how many times the loop needs to run — for example, when waiting for user input to meet a certain condition.\n",
