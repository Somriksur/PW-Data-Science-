        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which contain data (attributes) and code (methods). It promotes modularity, reusability, and encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP\n",
        "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It encapsulates data and behavior defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "Abstraction hides complexity by showing only essential details. Encapsulation restricts access to internal data using access modifiers (like private attributes in Python).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`, used to define behavior for operators and built-in functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire properties and methods from another class (parent), promoting code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "Polymorphism allows different classes to respond to the same method in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "Using private attributes (prefixing with `_` or `__`) and public methods to access or modify them.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "A constructor is a special method `__init__` used to initialize objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "Class methods use `@classmethod` and take `cls` as a parameter; static methods use `@staticmethod` and don’t access class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "Python does not support method overloading natively. It's simulated by using default parameters or `*args`.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "Overriding is redefining a parent class’s method in a child class with the same name and parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "`@property` is used to make a method behave like an attribute, commonly for getter/setter purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "It enables flexibility and interface generalization by allowing objects of different types to be treated the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "An abstract class cannot be instantiated and is created using the `ABC` module with `@abstractmethod`.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "Modularity, code reusability, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "Class variables are shared among all instances; instance variables are unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "A class can inherit from more than one class, e.g., `class C(A, B):`—Python supports it natively.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python\n",
        "`__str__`: for readable representation; `__repr__`: for unambiguous representation (for developers/debugging).\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python\n",
        "`super()` is used to call methods from a parent class, especially during inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python\n",
        "`__del__` is a destructor method called when an object is garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "`@staticmethod`: doesn’t access class or instance data.  \n",
        "`@classmethod`: takes `cls` and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "Derived classes override base class methods, and those are called based on the actual object type at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "Calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line, each returning self.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "Allows an object to be called like a function. Used in decorators, function-like objects, etc.\n"
